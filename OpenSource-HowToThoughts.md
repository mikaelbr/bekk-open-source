# Open Source: Thoughts on Types of Open Source

As I (@mikaelbr) see it, there are different motivations of getting started with Open Source development and different people get different output from doing Open Source work. Originally started as more of an idealistic movement, but now it's more of a way of communicating, organise, maintain, support, learn of, doing recruitment, and/or using as a development methodology.

Open Source has existed as long as computers has existed, and even way before personal computers. In the US there were hack-busses driving around the country in the 60s with open source mentality. Now, for the last 10-15 years, we have what I like to call a second generation open source. A lot of it came with Github (et.al.). In the second generation Open Source, I think of "Open Source for Change", not "open for spectating". Although source code is disclosed, it's so much more.

Open Source is it's own field of study. And in later years many universities and Ph.d students have run studies on ways of doing Open Source development. There are a lot of things to look into: How to effectively do distributed work? How do you communicate for better collaboration? What does it mean to be free of charge? Are all Open Source projects free? Even if license say it's free, does it mean it comes without cost?

In Open Source we often distinguish between three roles: Maintainers, Collaborators, and Users. Maintainers collectively own a project. Maintainers can be one or more persons. Or if the project is unmaintained, it has no maintainers. Maintainers often have more say in overall development of a project and can have final word. Collaborators are in a way similar to maintainers, but technically a collaborator can be seen as someone who has committed resources to a project. It is also a role on Github saying who should have commit access. Collaborators and Maintainers doesn't have to do just code. Often things like docs, wiki-maintaining, graphics, issues answering/helping, community involvement is a good and important way to be collaborator. The final role, Users is maybe self explanatory, but it's an important part also. The way Users communicate in an Open Source setting is important. Not only for motivation for maintainers and collaborators, but to create a welcoming, friendly environment.

## How to Get Involved

There are different types of Open Source-work, in my mind: "the active seeker", "the reactive scout", "the passive improver" and "the opportunistic instigator".

### The Archetypes of Open Source Contributors

#### The Active Seeker

This is someone who is interested in getting involved in Open Source for any number of reasons, but doesn't have a clear idea where to start or what project to look at. The user seeks different sources to contribute to. The user should know how to technically do a pull request, and a good idea is to start small to get the ball rolling. When finding a project to contribute to, the user can take advantage of the familiarity of the code base to contribute more.

#### The Reactive Scout

The reactive scout, isn't actively seeking out projects to contribute to, but looks for every opportunity to do so. When opening a project or reading about a project, the reactive scout sees things as outdated examples, poor wording, code inconsistencies and improve them before moving on. Like a boy scout/girl scout developer, improving as you go.

Finding projects to contribute to:

* Keep eyes open, and think about how projects can be improved.

#### The Passive Improver

The passive improver is first and foremost an user of Open Source software. In daily work or on private projects, the passive improver is an expert consumer, having used projects. Sometimes the passive improver comes a cross a difficulty with a project they use. Like a difficult to understand documentation, an issue, or a potential feature that in their mind would improve the project. The passive improver then proposes that change to the maintainers and help out making the project better. In time, the passive improver, much like the active seeker, can become maintainer or collaborator of a project.

Finding projects to contribute to:

* When one come across bugs or other issues with a project in your daily work, improve upstream.

#### The Opportunistic Instigator

The instigator identifies solutions they have as potentially nice-to-have for others and creates a open source project out of it. The instigator can also be interested in getting feedback and/or validation of ideas and use open source to get it.
